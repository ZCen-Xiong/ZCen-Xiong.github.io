<summary>Abstract </summary>
The deterministic control methods have limited autonomy and difficulties in handling nonlinear constraints in satellite formation flying. How to achieve near-optimal/optimal multi-agent cooperation, reconfiguration and collision avoidance control in the absence/insufficient knowledge of prior dynamics? 
This thesis addresses the demands of multi-spacecraft formation tasks. Multi-agent learning based MPC is being developed for satellite formation flying tracking problems. Meanwhile, the agents are being trained in some typical formation flying environments, such as space target observation, formation communication, and obstacle avoidance reconfiguration.

<summary>Abstract </summary>
As astronauts conduct experiments more frequently on the space station, there is a growing trend in research on free-flying robots capable of assisting them with various tasks. This paper introduces a new class of free-flying robot named Bifang, designed to enhance astronauts' lives and improve their efficiency in space. Bifang is a deployable cubic robot that measures 20cm×20cm×20cm when folded. Once expanded, the robot offers a range of functions, including autonomous and remote-controlled flight capabilities, the ability to grasp and carry objects, expression recognition to regulate emotions, a simple and efficient UI interaction, and health management features. Double-gimbal fans enables the robot to have 6 DoF. SLAM mapping is used for in-cabin navigation. The PyTorch deep neural network is applied to monitoring astronauts's emotion. The prototype is still under development.

<summary>Abstract </summary>
The problem A of 12th China Trajectory Optimization Competition (CTOC) is about Martian migration via reusable transport stations. The mission requires a global trajectory design, which includes departure from the distant retrograde orbit (DRO), encountering with the Earth and Mars in sequence, returning and insertion to the DRO finally. This paper introduces the method and results of Beihang University (BUAA) and the Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation, consisting of the design of interplanetary transfers, as well as escapes and captures of the Earth-Moon system, the planning of massive missions and the optimization of numbers of stations. The feasible windows of the interplanetary transfer are obtained by developing a definitelymatching gravity-assist optimization method. The low-energy escapes and captures in the Earth-Moon system is achieved via the establishing and solving of a time-phase decoupling nonlinear programming model and the design of phase adjustment maneuvers. An algorithm is proposed to select a combination of transport missions which satisfies constraints and enables maximum number of immigrants. The minimum quantity of stations is obtained by programming. The final result enables a 4320 people migration to Mars by 24 transport stations during 20 years, ranking third out of all teams participating in the competition.

<summary>Abstract </summary>
By applying the bilinear tangent (BLT) guidance law, a near-optimal and computationally efficient BLT constant-thrust guidance (BCG) algorithm is introduced for orbital transfers about a binary asteroid system. This algorithm is accomplished by using BLT guidance law combined with Newton–Raphson predictor–corrector algorithm and manifold patching techniques. BCG can plan a variety of fuel efficient constant-thrust state/orbit to state/orbit transfers based on the types of the initial/target orbits and the selected maneuver types, including single burn transfers and multiple burn transfers leveraging manifolds. For the study case of 66391 Moshup, a 600 kg, BCG-guided spacecraft with a 24 mN thruster performed an aggressive non-coplanar transfer between L1 and L2 Halo orbits at the cost of only 3.38 g of fuel. Then the BCG-guided trajectories’ robustness is validated thoroughly by N=600 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. Finally, BCG’s excellent tradeoff between computational efficiency and near-optimality is well demonstrated by comparison with well-established optimization methods. For example, in a coplanar transfer with a 1.5 mN thruster, BCG can converge over 200 times faster than interior point optimization with only a 9% cost surplus in fuel compared to the optimum. It is indicated that BCG algorithm is a promising option for autonomous orbital control in binary asteroid missions considering its computational and fuel efficiency.
